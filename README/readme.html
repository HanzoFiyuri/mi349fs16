<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I'm from Ann Arbor, Michigan. I'm a part of a family of six, being my dad, mom, older brother, older sister, and little brother. I graduated from Skyline High School (Mascot being an Eagle, and yes, it totally sounds like an airport) in 2013, and was on the varsity bowling team, and was vice president of the anime club. I'm currently living in an apartment with three other roommates in East Lansing. And hopefully I'll be on a trip to Japan within the next two years.</p>
